# percy-node

This is a wrapper of [percy-js]() that simplifies the API so it can be used for node based test workflows.

## How to use
TODO(bogusred)

## Motivation
This package was originally created specifically to allow testing of Express AngularJS apps tested with Jasmine, Karma, and Protractor. However, it is written in a general enough way that it could be used in another node based testing environment.
